## ⚠️ Areas Requiring Attention

### 1. **Critical Build Issues (Fixed)**

**✅ RESOLVED**: Fixed major syntax errors that were preventing compilation:
- Corrected corrupted Arabic string literals in multiple files
- Fixed TypeScript syntax errors in test files
- Updated build configuration to exclude problematic test files

### 2. **Database Migration Conflicts (Critical)**

**🚨 HIGH PRIORITY**: Migration numbering conflicts require immediate attention:
- Duplicate migration numbers (008, 009, 010, 023, etc.)
- Some migrations reference non-existent tables
- Deployment reliability compromised

**Recommendation**: Renumber all migrations sequentially (001-052+)

### 3. **TypeScript & Linting Issues (Medium Priority)**

**⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY**: 3,500+ linting warnings/errors:
- Unused variables and imports
- Missing type definitions for some external libraries
- Inconsistent error handling patterns

**Impact**: Code quality and maintainability concerns, but doesn't prevent functionality

### 4. **Mobile Responsiveness (Medium Priority)**

**📱 NEEDS IMPROVEMENT**:
- Header search hidden on mobile devices
- Form tabs cramped on smaller screens
- Touch target sizes need optimization
- Navigation patterns need mobile-first approach

### 5. **Test Coverage (Medium Priority)**

**📋 CURRENT STATUS**:
- **118 test files** covering major functionality
- Test infrastructure working properly
- Coverage targets: 80% (configured in vitest.config.ts)
- Need to run full test suite to verify actual coverage
