## Technique 1: Morphological Analysis
**Status:** In Progress
**Description:** Breaking down complex system into key parameters and exploring combinations

### Core Parameters Identified:

**System Architecture:**
- Program Types (Annual Growth, etc.)
- Session Categories (Speech Therapy, Educational Therapy, etc.)
- Scheduling Patterns (frequency, days per week)
- Attendance Levels (Center vs Session)

**Human Interaction & Communication:**
- Parent Communication Channels (chat with assigned therapists)
- Therapist Dashboard Views (personal calendar, assigned sessions)
- Communication Permissions (parents â†” assigned therapist only)
- Therapist Assignment Model (per session type, per child)

**Assignment & Substitution Rules:**
- Therapist Specialization (1 therapist = 1 session type per child)
- Availability Management (not currently an issue)
- Substitute Notification System (parents must be notified)
- Communication Restrictions (parents chat only with primary assigned therapist, NOT substitutes)

**Freeze & Rescheduling Dependencies:**
- Auto-Calendar Updates (therapist calendars update automatically with new dates)
- Conflict Resolution (manual editing required when time slots overlap)
- Communication Continuity (chat supports files, photos, videos, progress updates)

**Media & Communication Types:**
- Text Messages
- File Attachments
- Photo Sharing (progress documentation)
- Video Sharing (session recordings/demonstrations)
- Voice Chat (real-time communication)
- Progress Update Notifications

**Communication Workflow:**
- Immediate Post-Session Sharing (therapist sends progress media immediately)
- Bidirectional Home Practice Documentation (parents share home videos/photos)
- Priority Alert System (concerning content triggers therapist notifications)
- Real-Time Voice Communication (voice chat capability)

**Notification Priorities:**
- Standard Progress Updates
- Priority Alerts (concerning parent-shared content)
- Session Reminders
- Substitute Therapist Notifications

**User-Generated Parameters:**
