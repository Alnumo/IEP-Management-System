## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 implementation:
- **Healthcare Compliance**: Established HIPAA/PDPL compliant synthetic data patterns and database isolation validation
- **Test Infrastructure**: 80% coverage target achieved with healthcare-grade testing patterns
- **Arabic RTL Support**: Comprehensive bilingual testing framework operational for security UI components
- **Database Security**: Isolation validation prevents production data contamination (addresses DATA-001 risk)

### Technical Context
**Current Security State**: Partial implementation with critical gaps blocking production deployment  
[Source: architecture/security-considerations.md]  
[Source: architecture/technical-debt-and-known-issues.md#critical-technical-debt]

**Existing Security Infrastructure**:
- Supabase Auth with JWT tokens configured
- Basic RLS policies (some tables unprotected) 
- SecurityService class with TOTP infrastructure (incomplete implementation)
- Audit trail basic implementation (needs enhancement)
- Data encryption structure ready but not implemented for medical records
- Saudi PDPL compliance structure ready but implementation pending
[Source: architecture/security-considerations.md]

### Data Models
**Medical Records Security**: 
- Table: `medical_records` with JSONB fields ready for encryption
- Encryption target fields: `medical_history`, `current_medications`, `coverage_details`
- Medical record numbers format: MED-2025-0001 (auto-generated)
- ICD-10 codes in array format for diagnosis tracking
[Source: database/012_medical_foundation_schema.sql]

**Security Infrastructure Tables**:
- `two_factor_settings`: TOTP secret management (user_id, secret_key, backup_codes_used)
- `backup_codes`: Recovery code management (code_hash, is_used, used_at)
- `verification_attempts`: Audit trail for 2FA attempts (attempt_type, ip_address, user_agent)
- `audit_logs`: Basic audit infrastructure (needs enhancement)
[Source: src/services/security-service.ts]

### API Specifications
**Existing Security Service Functions**:
- `generateTotpSecret(userId)` - TOTP secret generation via Supabase RPC
- `verifyTotpCode(userId, totpCode)` - TOTP verification system
- `generateBackupCodes(userId)` - Recovery code generation
- Supabase RPC functions: `generate_totp_secret`, `verify_totp_code`
[Source: src/services/security-service.ts]

**Required Enhancements**:
- AES-256 encryption service for medical data
- Enhanced audit logging for all medical operations
- RLS policy management interfaces
- Data retention automation APIs

### File Locations for Implementation
- **Security Services**: `src/services/security-service.ts` (enhance existing)
- **Encryption Service**: `src/services/encryption-service.ts` (create new)
- **Audit Services**: `src/services/audit-service.ts` (enhance existing)
- **2FA Components**: `src/components/auth/TwoFactorSetup.tsx` (create new)
- **Security Dashboard**: `src/components/admin/SecurityDashboard.tsx` (create new)
- **Database Migrations**: `database/053_security_enhancements.sql` (create new)
- **RLS Policies**: `database/054_enhanced_rls_policies.sql` (create new)

### Technical Constraints
**Healthcare Compliance Requirements**:
- HIPAA compliance for medical record encryption
- Saudi PDPL standards for data protection
- Audit trail retention requirements for healthcare data
- Medical data access logging mandatory
[Source: architecture/security-considerations.md]

**Technology Stack Constraints**:
- Supabase 2.45.4 backend with PostgreSQL security features
- React 18.2.0 + TypeScript 5.2.2 for security UI components  
- Existing authentication via Supabase Auth with JWT patterns
- Must maintain Arabic/English bilingual support in security interfaces
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#actual-tech-stack]

**Performance Requirements**:
- Sub-500ms API response times must be maintained with encryption overhead
- Database query performance with RLS policies under 50ms target
- Security operations should not impact existing therapy workflow performance
[Source: epic requirements]

### Integration Requirements
**Database Integration**: Must work with existing Supabase client singleton pattern without breaking current authentication flows  
**Medical Records**: Transparent encryption/decryption must not affect existing medical record workflows  
**User Experience**: 2FA implementation must integrate seamlessly with existing login/admin flows  
[Source: architecture/technical-debt-and-known-issues.md#workarounds-and-gotchas]

### Project Structure Context
**Security Module Organization**: Following existing service pattern in `src/services/` directory  
**Component Architecture**: Security components follow shadcn/ui + Radix UI patterns established in project  
**Test Structure**: Security tests must follow P0/P1/P2 priority system established in Story 1.1  
[Source: architecture/source-tree-and-module-organization.md#project-structure]

### Critical Security Gaps to Address
1. **Encryption Service**: Exists but not applied to medical records (CRITICAL)
2. **2FA Implementation**: Database support exists but no UI implementation
3. **API Security Service**: Incomplete implementation
4. **RLS Policies**: Some tables have disabled RLS (security risk)
5. **Audit Trail**: Basic implementation needs enhancement for HIPAA compliance
[Source: architecture/technical-debt-and-known-issues.md#critical-technical-debt]

## Integration Verification
**IV1**: Existing user authentication flows remain functional during security enhancement  
**IV2**: Current medical records data integrity preserved during encryption implementation  
**IV3**: Performance impact of security features maintains sub-500ms API responses

## Testing

### Testing Standards
**Test File Location**: `src/test/` directory with subdirectories mirroring source structure  
**Test Framework**: Vitest 3.2.4 with @testing-library/react patterns from Story 1.1 infrastructure  
**Coverage Requirements**: Minimum 80% code coverage for all security-related code  
**Arabic Testing**: Must validate Arabic text rendering in security UI components  
**Healthcare Testing**: Must validate HIPAA/PDPL compliance patterns established in Story 1.1  

**Security-Specific Testing Requirements**:
- Encryption/decryption functionality with synthetic medical data
- 2FA flow testing with Arabic/English interfaces
- RLS policy validation with role-based access tests
- Audit trail generation and retention testing
- Performance testing with encryption overhead validation
