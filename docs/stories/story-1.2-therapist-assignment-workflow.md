# Story 1.2: Advanced Therapist Assignment & Substitute Workflow - Brownfield Enhancement

## User Story

**As a therapy center administrator,**
**I want an automated therapist assignment system that ensures each student has exactly one therapist per specialization with proper substitute notification and communication restrictions,**
**So that we maintain therapeutic consistency while handling staff changes transparently and professionally.**

## Story Context

### **Existing System Integration:**

- **Integrates with**: Current therapist management system (90% complete), student management (95% complete), existing CourseAssignment infrastructure
- **Technology**: Existing CourseAssignment table, Therapist specialization fields, current notification infrastructure
- **Follows pattern**: Existing useTherapists and useStudents hooks, CourseAssignment logic, established notification patterns
- **Touch points**: Therapist dashboard, student profiles, CourseAssignment system, parent communication system (Story 1.1)

## Acceptance Criteria

### **Functional Requirements:**

1. **One Therapist Per Specialization**: Each student automatically assigned exactly one primary therapist per therapy specialization (Speech Therapy, Occupational Therapy, ABA, etc.)
2. **Assignment Validation**: System prevents multiple primary therapist assignments for same specialization per student
3. **Specialization Matching**: Therapist assignments respect therapist specialization_ar/specialization_en fields
4. **Assignment History**: Complete audit trail of all therapist assignments and changes with bilingual documentation

### **Substitute Management Workflow:**

5. **Automatic Substitute Detection**: System identifies when primary therapist unavailable and triggers substitute assignment using existing assignment_type 'substitute'
6. **Parent Notification**: Parents automatically notified when substitute therapist assigned with substitute's basic information in Arabic and English
7. **Communication Restrictions**: Parents can ONLY message their child's assigned primary therapist through Story 1.1 messaging system (not substitutes)
8. **Substitute Session Documentation**: Substitute therapists can document sessions but cannot initiate parent communication

### **Integration Requirements:**

9. **Existing CourseAssignment Enhancement**: Builds on current CourseAssignment table without breaking existing course enrollment functionality
10. **Therapist Dashboard Integration**: Assignment changes reflect immediately in existing therapist dashboard calendars and course views
11. **Parent Portal Respect**: New assignment rules integrate with existing parent portal without disrupting current access patterns
12. **Notification System Extension**: Uses existing notification infrastructure without conflicting with current parent/therapist notification settings

### **Quality Requirements:**

13. **Existing Functionality Preserved**: All current therapist management, course assignments, and student enrollment features continue working unchanged
14. **Assignment Conflict Prevention**: System prevents assignment conflicts that could disrupt existing scheduled courses and therapy sessions
15. **Data Integrity**: Assignment changes maintain referential integrity with existing Student, Therapist, and Course records

## Technical Implementation Notes

### **Integration Approach:**
- **CourseAssignment Extension**: Extend existing CourseAssignment table with specialization-based assignment rules
- **Assignment Logic**: Enhance current therapist assignment logic to enforce one-therapist-per-specialization rule
- **Communication Integration**: Link assignment validation with Story 1.1 messaging permissions
- **Notification Enhancement**: Extend existing notification system with substitute assignment templates

### **Existing Pattern References:**
- **Data Hooks**: Create useTherapistAssignments hook following useTherapists and useStudents patterns
- **Form Components**: Follow existing CourseAssignment form patterns for assignment management UI
- **UI Components**: Use existing shadcn/ui components with Arabic RTL support for assignment interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Follow existing error boundary and toast notification patterns

### **Key Technical Constraints:**
- **Must maintain**: Existing CourseAssignment functionality and course enrollment workflows
- **Must respect**: Current Therapist specialization_ar/specialization_en fields and business logic
- **Must extend**: Existing Arabic/English bilingual infrastructure for assignment notifications
- **Must integrate**: Story 1.1 messaging system for communication permission validation

### **Database Schema Extensions:**
```sql
-- Extend existing CourseAssignment table
ALTER TABLE course_assignments 
ADD COLUMN is_primary_for_specialization BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
ADD COLUMN substitute_for_therapist_id UUID REFERENCES therapists(id),
ADD COLUMN assignment_notification_sent BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
ADD COLUMN specialization_override VARCHAR(100);

-- Create specialization assignment rules
CREATE TABLE therapist_specialization_assignments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  student_id UUID REFERENCES students(id) NOT NULL,
  specialization_ar VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  specialization_en VARCHAR(100),
  primary_therapist_id UUID REFERENCES therapists(id) NOT NULL,
  assigned_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  status 'active' | 'inactive' | 'transferred' DEFAULT 'active',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(student_id, specialization_ar)
);
```

## Advanced Acceptance Criteria

### **User Experience Requirements:**

16. **Assignment Dashboard**: Administrators can view all student-therapist assignments in organized dashboard with specialization groupings
17. **Assignment History View**: Complete assignment timeline for each student showing all therapist changes with dates and reasons
18. **Bulk Assignment Management**: Administrators can create assignments for multiple students with same specialization simultaneously
19. **Assignment Conflict Detection**: System automatically detects and prevents conflicting assignments with clear error messages

### **Specialization Management Features:**

20. **Specialization Mapping**: System maps therapist specializations with course types and therapy programs automatically
21. **Substitute Pool by Specialization**: Administrators can define approved substitute therapists per specialization type
22. **Emergency Assignment Workflow**: Rapid substitute assignment interface for urgent situations with notification automation
23. **Therapist Workload Balance**: System suggests assignment distribution to balance therapist caseloads across specializations

### **Communication & Notification Integration:**

24. **Assignment-Based Messaging Permissions**: Story 1.1 messaging system automatically enforces assignment rules for parent-therapist communication
25. **Substitute Assignment Notifications**: Parents receive bilingual notifications when substitute assigned with therapist information and session details
26. **Assignment Change Communication**: Parents notified in Arabic/English when permanent therapist assignments change with transition timeline
27. **Therapist Assignment Alerts**: Therapists receive notifications when assigned new students with student background and specialization requirements

## Technical Architecture Notes

### **Integration with Existing Systems:**
- **Therapist Management**: Extends current Therapist type with specialization-based assignment tracking
- **Student Profiles**: Enhances existing Student interface with assigned therapist visualization per specialization
- **Course System**: Integrates with existing Course and CourseAssignment tables for therapy session assignments
- **Parent Portal**: Links with existing parent portal infrastructure for assignment visibility

### **Mobile & Responsive Design:**

1. **Phased Implementation**: Deploy assignment rules gradually, starting with new student enrollments before applying to existing students
2. **Assignment Override System**: Administrators can manually override specialization assignments for exceptional therapeutic cases
3. **Existing Assignment Preservation**: All current CourseAssignment records remain unchanged during system enhancement
4. **Validation Layer**: Multi-step validation prevents assignments that conflict with existing course schedules

### **Secondary Risk:** Parent communication restrictions could cause confusion when substitute therapists are assigned

### **Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Clear Communication Templates**: Bilingual notification templates clearly explain substitute assignment and communication procedures
2. **Emergency Communication Path**: Emergency contact system allows critical communication with substitutes when needed
3. **Assignment Transparency**: Parents can view complete assignment history and current therapist status through parent portal
