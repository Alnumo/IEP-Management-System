3. IDEA 2024 compliance validation ensures all required IEP components
4. Arabic PDF export functionality generates culturally appropriate IEP documents
5. IEP meeting scheduling integrates with existing session management system
6. Electronic signature system maintains audit trail for IEP approvals

## Integration Verification
