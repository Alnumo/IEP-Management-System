## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.4 implementation:
- **Architectural Excellence**: Comprehensive 650-927 line component implementations with healthcare-grade security
- **Healthcare Compliance**: AES-256 encryption, PDPL compliance, and comprehensive audit trails proven effective
- **Bilingual Support**: Arabic RTL layouts and cultural sensitivity patterns established successfully
- **Integration Success**: Supabase Realtime, WhatsApp Business API, and n8n automation patterns proven robust
- **Testing Patterns**: Comprehensive test suites with Arabic RTL validation provide excellent coverage model

### Data Models
**Billing System Schema**: Comprehensive database schema already implemented with Saudi Arabia financial compliance
- Primary tables: `invoices`, `invoice_items`, `payments`, `payment_plans`, `payment_installments`
- Insurance tables: `insurance_providers`, `insurance_claims` with major Saudi insurers pre-loaded
- Service rates: `service_rates` table with therapy pricing (ABA: 250 SAR, Speech: 200 SAR, etc.)
- VAT compliance: 15% Saudi VAT automatically calculated with proper tax_amount fields
- Payment methods: Support for MADA, STC Pay, bank transfer, cash, and insurance payments
- RLS policies: Complete Row Level Security implementation with organization-based access

**Integration Points**: Financial system connects to existing student and session management
- Session linking: `invoice_items.session_id` references `therapy_sessions.id` for accurate billing
- Student tracking: All financial records link to `students.id` for comprehensive account management  
- Parent integration: `invoices.parent_id` connects to existing parent portal for payment visibility
[Source: database/023_billing_system_schema.sql#invoice_items]

### API Specifications
**Payment Gateway Service**: Existing service foundation with Saudi Arabia payment method support
- PaymentGatewayService class: Multi-gateway support with MADA (2.5% fee), STC Pay, and bank transfer
- Saudi-specific validation: Phone numbers, IBAN formats, and payment method restrictions
- Currency support: SAR primary with USD secondary for international patients
- Security compliance: PCI-DSS patterns and tokenization support for recurring payments
[Source: src/services/payment-gateway-service.ts]

**Financial API Integration**: Supabase client patterns with financial data security
- Encrypted payment data: AES-256 encryption for sensitive financial information
- Real-time updates: Supabase Realtime subscriptions for payment status and balance updates
- Audit trail integration: All financial operations logged with user tracking and timestamps
[Source: src/lib/supabase.ts, database/023_billing_system_schema.sql#functions]

### Component Specifications
**File Locations for Implementation**:
- **Billing Components**: `src/components/billing/` (enhance existing incomplete components)
  - PaymentGatewayInterface.tsx - Multi-gateway payment processing interface
  - InvoiceAutomation.tsx - Automated invoice generation and management
  - FinancialAnalyticsDashboard.tsx - Real-time financial reporting dashboard
  
- **Payment Components**: `src/components/billing/` (build on existing installment components)

### Integration Requirements
**IV1**: Existing enrollment fees and payment tracking data preserved during financial system enhancement
**IV2**: Current session attendance records automatically inform billing calculations  
**IV3**: Student and parent contact information seamlessly supports invoice delivery

**External Integration Dependencies**:
- PayTabs Saudi Gateway: `src/services/payment-gateway-service.ts` needs completion for live transactions
- Insurance APIs: Bupa Arabia and Tawuniya integration requires API credentials and testing
- WhatsApp Business API: Leverage existing integration from Story 1.4 for payment reminders
[Source: docs/architecture/integration-points-and-external-dependencies.md]

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack Constraints**:
- React 18.2.0 + TypeScript 5.2.2 with existing shadcn/ui patterns and Arabic font support
- Supabase 2.45.4 backend with established RLS policies and financial data encryption
- TanStack Query v5 for server state management (5-min cache, 10-min GC) with payment data
- Arabic/English bilingual support using existing i18n infrastructure and RTL layouts
[Source: docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md#actual-tech-stack]

**Security Requirements**:
- All financial data must use AES-256 encryption (established in previous stories)
- PCI-DSS compliance required for payment card processing
- Saudi PDPL data residency and retention compliance for financial records
- Comprehensive audit trails required for all financial transactions
[Source: docs/architecture/security-considerations.md, database/023_billing_system_schema.sql#functions]

**Performance Requirements**:
- Payment processing response time < 3 seconds for card transactions
- Financial dashboard load time < 2 seconds with real-time data updates
- Invoice generation time < 1 second for standard invoices with Arabic PDF support
- Bulk payment processing capability for 100+ transactions per batch
[Source: docs/architecture/performance-considerations.md]

### Project Structure Context
**Component Architecture**: All financial components follow established shadcn/ui + Radix UI patterns with Arabic support
**Service Layer**: Financial services integrate with existing Supabase client singleton pattern and encryption services
**Database Integration**: Financial tables use existing RLS policies and audit trail infrastructure
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree-and-module-organization.md#project-structure]

**Critical Implementation Gaps to Address**:
1. **Payment Gateway Integration**: PayTabs and Stripe APIs need completion with live credentials and webhook processing
2. **Insurance API Integration**: Bupa Arabia and Tawuniya API connectivity not implemented
3. **Automated Invoice Generation**: PDF generation with Arabic support needs completion
4. **Real-time Financial Dashboard**: Analytics aggregation and real-time updates need implementation
5. **Installment Payment Automation**: Payment collection and reminder automation needs WhatsApp integration

## Testing

### Testing Standards
**Test File Location**: `src/test/` directory with subdirectories mirroring source structure
**Test Framework**: Vitest 3.2.4 with @testing-library/react patterns established in Story 1.1
**Coverage Requirements**: Minimum 80% code coverage for all financial-related code
**Arabic Testing**: Must validate Arabic text rendering and RTL layout in all financial components
**Financial Testing**: Must validate payment processing flows, tax calculations, and currency formatting

**Financial-Specific Testing Requirements**:
- Payment gateway integration testing with mock payment responses and error handling
- Invoice generation testing with Arabic PDF validation and VAT calculation accuracy
- Insurance claim workflow testing with provider API simulation and status tracking
- Financial reporting testing with data aggregation accuracy and real-time updates
