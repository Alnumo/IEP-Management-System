# Story 1.2: Security Compliance & Data Protection

**Epic**: Epic 1: Arkan Al-Numo Production Readiness & System Completion

**Story ID**: 1.2

**Priority**: Critical (Compliance Required)

**Estimate**: 7-10 days

## User Story

As a **Healthcare Administrator**,  
I want **full HIPAA-compliant data encryption and audit systems**,  
so that **medical records meet Saudi PDPL standards and healthcare data protection requirements**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. AES-256 encryption implemented for existing medical records without data loss
2. Two-factor authentication added for admin and manager roles
3. Comprehensive audit trail system tracks all medical data operations
4. Row Level Security policies enhanced for new security requirements
5. Data retention policies automated with compliance reporting
6. Penetration testing completed with zero critical vulnerabilities

## Integration Verification

**IV1**: Existing user authentication flows remain functional during security enhancement
**IV2**: Current medical records data integrity preserved during encryption implementation
**IV3**: Performance impact of security features maintains sub-500ms API responses

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] All integration verification points passed
- [ ] Security audit completed with no critical issues
- [ ] Compliance documentation updated
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested
- [ ] Performance impact validated

## Dependencies

- Existing encryption service (placeholder exists)
- Supabase RLS policies (partially implemented)
- Medical records data structure (established)
- Security audit tools or external security firm

## Risks & Mitigation

**Risk**: Data encryption may impact performance
**Mitigation**: Implement caching strategies and optimize encryption operations

**Risk**: 2FA implementation may disrupt existing users
**Mitigation**: Phased rollout starting with admin users, provide clear migration path

**Risk**: Audit trail storage may grow rapidly
**Mitigation**: Implement data retention policies and archival strategies

## Technical Notes

- Leverage existing `src/services/encryption-service.ts` (needs implementation)
- Enhance `src/services/security-service.ts` for 2FA
- Utilize existing audit trail infrastructure in database
- Apply encryption at rest and in transit for all medical data
