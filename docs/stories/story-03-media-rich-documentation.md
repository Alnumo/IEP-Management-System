# Story 1.3: Media-Rich Progress Documentation Workflow - Brownfield Enhancement

## User Story

**As a therapist,**
**I want to immediately share photos, videos, and progress updates with parents after each therapy session while enabling parents to share home practice documentation,**
**So that we create a comprehensive, collaborative record of the student's therapeutic journey with rich visual documentation.**

## Story Context

### **Existing System Integration:**

- **Integrates with**: Current session management system (85% complete), existing parent-therapist messaging infrastructure, Supabase storage system
- **Technology**: Existing session documentation, current media storage bucket, established progress notes system
- **Follows pattern**: Existing file upload patterns, session management hooks, progress documentation workflows
- **Touch points**: Session completion workflow, parent portal progress viewing, therapist session documentation, existing media storage

## Acceptance Criteria

### **Post-Session Media Sharing:**

1. **Immediate Upload Capability**: Therapists can upload photos and videos (up to 50MB) immediately after session completion
2. **Progress Media Categorization**: Media automatically tagged by session type, date, and therapeutic goals
3. **Quick Caption System**: Therapists add brief captions in Arabic or English with voice-to-text support
4. **Batch Upload**: Multiple media files uploaded simultaneously with progress indicators

### **Bidirectional Home Practice Documentation:**

5. **Parent Media Upload**: Parents can upload home practice videos and photos through existing parent portal
6. **Home Practice Organization**: Parent-uploaded media organized by date and therapy type for therapist review
7. **Practice Validation**: Therapists can mark home practice media as "reviewed" with brief feedback
8. **Practice Guidance**: Therapists can respond to home practice uploads with corrective guidance media

### **Media Workflow Integration:**

9. **Session Documentation Integration**: Media uploads automatically linked to existing session notes and progress tracking
10. **IEP Goal Connection**: Media can be tagged with specific IEP goals for progress documentation
11. **Timeline Visualization**: Media appears in existing student progress timeline with therapeutic context
12. **Assessment Integration**: Media can be used as evidence for existing assessment tool evaluations

### **Quality & Compliance:**

13. **Existing Progress System Intact**: All current session note and progress documentation features continue unchanged
14. **Media Security**: Same security controls as existing medical records apply to therapy session media
15. **Storage Optimization**: Media compression and optimization without quality loss
16. **Backup Integration**: Media included in existing system backup and recovery procedures

## Technical Implementation Architecture

### **Media Processing Pipeline:**
```typescript
// Extend existing Supabase storage with organized structure
Media Storage Structure:
├── session-media/
│   ├── {student-id}/
│   │   ├── {session-type}/
│   │   │   ├── {date}/
│   │   │   │   ├── therapist-uploads/
│   │   │   │   └── parent-uploads/
│   │   └── progress-timeline/
└── compressed/
    └── {optimized-versions}/
```

### **Integration with Existing Systems:**
- **Session Management**: Extend useSession hook with media upload capabilities
- **Progress Tracking**: Enhance existing progress components with media gallery
- **Parent Portal**: Add media upload section to existing parent dashboard
- **Notification System**: Extend current notification templates with media alerts

### **Database Schema Extensions:**
```sql
-- Extend existing session documentation
CREATE TABLE session_media (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  session_id UUID REFERENCES sessions(id),
  uploaded_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  media_type VARCHAR(20), -- photo, video, document
  file_path TEXT,
  caption TEXT,
  therapeutic_goals TEXT[],
  uploaded_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  reviewed_by UUID REFERENCES therapists(id),
  review_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending'
);
```

## Advanced Acceptance Criteria

18. **Progress Milestone Marking**: Therapists can mark specific media as "milestone achievements"
19. **Comparison Views**: Side-by-side comparison of progress media over time
20. **Media Analytics**: Basic analytics on media sharing frequency and engagement

### **Collaborative Documentation:**

21. **Shared Media Albums**: Create collaborative albums for specific therapeutic goals or time periods
22. **Media Annotations**: Therapists can add annotations and markup to parent-shared practice videos
23. **Practice Plan Integration**: Media linked to existing home practice plans and activities
24. **Team Sharing**: Multi-disciplinary team can access relevant media for coordinated care planning
