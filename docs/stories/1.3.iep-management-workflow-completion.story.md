## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2 implementation:
- **Security Infrastructure**: AES-256 encryption now available for sensitive IEP medical data protection
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive audit system in place for tracking all IEP modifications and access
- **RLS Policies**: Enhanced Row Level Security ensures therapy center data isolation for IEP records
- **Arabic RTL Support**: Security UI components demonstrate proper Arabic RTL implementation patterns
- **Testing Framework**: 80% coverage standard established with healthcare-grade compliance testing

### Technical Context
**Current IEP Infrastructure**: Comprehensive database schema with partial implementation  
[Source: database/024_iep_management_schema.sql]

**Existing IEP Components**: 25+ React components already created but require completion and integration  
[Source: src/components/iep/ directory structure]

### Data Models
**IEP Core Schema**: 
- Primary table: `ieps` with IDEA 2024 compliance fields (bilingual support)
- Goals tracking: `iep_goals` table with measurable annual goals structure  
- Progress data: `iep_progress_data` for goal tracking and data collection
- Team management: `iep_team_members` for collaborative development
- Meeting system: `iep_meetings` with attendance tracking
- Approval workflow: `iep_approvals` with digital signature support
- Compliance monitoring: `iep_compliance_alerts` for automated alerts
[Source: database/024_iep_management_schema.sql]

**Student Integration**: 
- Existing student profiles in `students` table ready for IEP integration
- Medical records with AES-256 encryption available for present levels
- Assessment results from existing assessment system for goal development
[Source: database/012_medical_foundation_schema.sql]

### API Specifications
**Existing IEP Service Functions**:
- `validateIEPCompliance()` - IDEA 2024 compliance validation (partial implementation)
- `createIEP()`, `updateIEP()` - Basic CRUD operations (skeleton implementation)
- IEP goal management functions (placeholder implementation)
- Progress tracking utilities (needs completion)
[Source: src/services/iep-service.ts]

**Required Enhancements**:
- Complete IEP CRUD operations with full business logic
- Collaborative editing APIs using Supabase Realtime
- PDF export service integration with Arabic typography
- Electronic signature workflow APIs
- Meeting scheduling integration with existing session system

### File Locations for Implementation
**Core IEP Services**: `src/services/iep-service.ts` (enhance existing skeleton)
**PDF Export Service**: `src/services/pdf-export-service.ts` (enhance with Arabic support)
**Components Directory**: `src/components/iep/` (complete existing components)
**Key Components to Complete**:
- `IEPCreationWizard.tsx` - Multi-step IEP creation workflow
- `IEPCollaborationHub.tsx` - Real-time collaborative editing
- `ComplianceAlertDashboard.tsx` - IDEA compliance monitoring
- `PDFExportCenter.tsx` - Arabic/English PDF generation
- `IEPMeetingScheduler.tsx` - Session system integration
- `IEPApprovalWorkflow.tsx` - Electronic signature workflow

### Technical Constraints
**IDEA 2024 Compliance Requirements**:
- Measurable annual goals with progress tracking mandatory
- Present levels of performance (academic/functional) required
- Team member participation and electronic signatures required
- Meeting documentation and attendance tracking mandatory
[Source: database/024_iep_management_schema.sql IDEA compliance comments]

**Integration Requirements**:
- Must integrate with existing student management system without breaking current workflows
- PDF export must support Arabic RTL typography with cultural appropriateness
- Meeting scheduling must coordinate with existing session management infrastructure
- Electronic signatures must maintain audit trails using existing security infrastructure

**Technology Stack Constraints**:
- React 18.2.0 + TypeScript 5.2.2 for UI components with existing shadcn/ui patterns
- Supabase 2.45.4 backend with existing RLS policies and authentication
- Existing TanStack Query v5 for server state management (5-min cache, 10-min GC)
- Arabic/English bilingual support using existing i18n infrastructure
[Source: docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md#actual-tech-stack]

### Integration Verification Requirements
**IV1**: Existing student management data seamlessly populates IEP workflows  
**IV2**: Current assessment system results automatically inform IEP goal development  
**IV3**: Session planning continues to reference IEP goals without workflow disruption

### Project Structure Context
**Component Architecture**: All IEP components follow established shadcn/ui + Radix UI patterns  
**Service Layer**: IEP services integrate with existing Supabase client singleton pattern  
**Database Integration**: IEP tables use existing RLS policies and encryption infrastructure  
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree-and-module-organization.md#project-structure]

### Critical Implementation Gaps to Address
1. **IEP Service Layer**: Skeleton implementation needs complete business logic
2. **Component Integration**: 25+ existing IEP components need completion and wiring
3. **PDF Export**: Arabic RTL typography not implemented
4. **Collaborative Editing**: Supabase Realtime integration missing
5. **Signature Workflow**: Digital signature system not implemented
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree-and-module-organization.md - IEP Management: SKELETON ONLY]

## Testing

### Testing Standards
**Test File Location**: `src/test/` directory with subdirectories mirroring source structure  
**Test Framework**: Vitest 3.2.4 with @testing-library/react patterns established in Story 1.1  
**Coverage Requirements**: Minimum 80% code coverage for all IEP-related code  
**Arabic Testing**: Must validate Arabic text rendering and RTL layout in all IEP components  
**Healthcare Testing**: Must validate IDEA 2024 compliance patterns and audit trail generation  

**IEP-Specific Testing Requirements**:
- IDEA 2024 compliance validation testing with synthetic IEP data
- Collaborative editing flow testing with multiple user simulation
- PDF export testing with Arabic typography validation
- Electronic signature workflow testing with audit trail verification
- Integration testing with existing student and assessment systems
