# Story 1.1: Testing Infrastructure Implementation

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** comprehensive unit and integration tests with 80% coverage across the entire application,
**so that** we can ensure code quality, prevent regressions, and maintain system stability as we add new features.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Achieve minimum 80% test coverage for all existing and new components as defined in NFR1
2. Implement unit tests for all React components using Vitest and React Testing Library
3. Create integration tests for critical user workflows (authentication, therapy sessions, IEP management)
4. Set up automated test execution in CI/CD pipeline with coverage reporting
5. Establish testing standards and documentation for future development
6. Ensure all tests support bilingual (Arabic RTL/English LTR) functionality
7. Add regression tests to prevent breaking existing functionality

  - [x] Document mocking patterns for Supabase and external APIs
  - [x] Create example test patterns for future development

## Dev Notes

This story implements the foundation for achieving NFR1 (80% test coverage) and addresses the critical testing gap identified in the gap analysis. All technical requirements have been extracted from the architecture documents.

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Test Framework:** All new tests must be added to the existing Vitest test suite with React Testing Library following "Arrange, Act, Assert" pattern.

**Coverage Requirements:** All new code (components, services, hooks) requires minimum 80% unit test coverage. Overall project coverage should increase.

**Test File Location:** Tests should mirror source structure - components in `src/components/` should have tests in `src/test/components/`

**Current Test Setup:** 
- Vitest with jsdom environment configured in `vitest.config.ts`
- Setup file at `src/test/setup.ts` with mocks for matchMedia, geolocation, and crypto APIs
- Coverage thresholds already set to 80% for branches, functions, lines, and statements

### Technical Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md]

**Testing Framework:** Continue using Vitest and React Testing Library as established
**Language:** All test code must be written in TypeScript 5.3 with strict mode
**React Version:** Tests must support React 18.2 functional components with hooks

### Integration with Existing Codebase
[Source: architecture/coding-standards-and-conventions.md]

**Test Patterns:** Must follow existing "Arrange, Act, Assert" pattern established in current tests
**Type Sharing:** Test types should be defined in `src/types/` for reuse across test files
**Error Handling:** Tests must work within existing multi-level ErrorBoundary structure
**Bilingual Testing:** All tests must include both Arabic and English language scenarios

### Project Structure Integration
[Source: architecture/source-tree-integration.md]

**Test Organization:** Tests should be organized by domain following the existing component structure:
- `src/test/components/admin/` - Administrative component tests
- `src/test/components/analytics/` - Analytics component tests  
- `src/test/components/auth/` - Authentication component tests
- `src/test/components/billing/` - Financial component tests
- `src/test/components/parent/` - Parent portal component tests
- `src/test/components/therapy/` - Therapy component tests

**File Naming:** All test files must follow `.test.tsx` convention for components and `.test.ts` for utilities

### Specific Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**New Testing Requirements:** Every new React component requires corresponding .test.tsx file covering:
- Rendering tests
- User interaction tests  
- All possible states (loading, error, success)
- Arabic and English language scenarios
- Mobile responsive behavior

**Integration Test Focus:** Critical for workflows including:
- Student enrollment and therapy session management
- Parent portal access and communication
- Billing and payment processing
- Medical record access and documentation

**Regression Test Coverage:** Must ensure core functionality remains intact:
- User authentication and authorization
- Data persistence and retrieval
- Bilingual interface switching
- Real-time updates and notifications

## Testing

### Unit Test Requirements
- Every React component must have corresponding .test.tsx file
- Minimum 80% coverage for branches, functions, lines, statements
- Tests must cover both Arabic RTL and English LTR scenarios
- Use React Testing Library with "Arrange, Act, Assert" pattern

### Integration Test Requirements  
- End-to-end workflow testing for critical user journeys
- Database integration testing with Supabase
- Authentication flow verification
- Bilingual functionality testing

### Test Environment Setup
- Vitest with jsdom environment
- Mocked browser APIs (matchMedia, geolocation, crypto)
- Supabase client mocking for database operations
- Arabic font and RTL layout testing utilities
