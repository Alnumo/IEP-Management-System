- VoiceCallManager service: Call state management with quality monitoring
- Push notification integration: Automated call notifications
[Source: src/hooks/useVoiceCall.ts, src/services/voice-communication-service.ts]

### Component Specifications
**File Locations for Implementation**:
- **Messaging Components**: `src/components/communication/` (enhance existing components)
  - MessageThread.tsx - Thread view with real-time updates
  - ConversationList.tsx - Conversation overview with presence
  - FileUpload.tsx - Media sharing interface (existing, needs enhancement)
  
- **Voice Call Components**: `src/components/communication/VoiceCall/` (create new directory)
  - VoiceCallInterface.tsx - Call UI with quality indicators
  - CallControls.tsx - Mute, end call, recording controls
  
- **Notification Components**: `src/components/communication/Notifications/` 
  - NotificationCenter.tsx - In-app notification management
  - PushNotificationManager.tsx - Browser push integration

### Integration Requirements
**IV1**: Existing parent portal dashboard continues functioning alongside new messaging features
**IV2**: Current notification preferences and user settings preserved during communication enhancement  
**IV3**: Session documentation workflow maintains integration with new communication channels

**WhatsApp Business API Integration**:
- Webhook endpoints: `supabase/functions/whatsapp-webhook/` (create new edge function)
- Message templates: Bilingual templates for appointment reminders and progress updates
- n8n workflows: `n8n/workflows/whatsapp-automation.json` (enhance existing automation)
[Source: docs/architecture/integration-points-and-external-dependencies.md]

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack Constraints**:
- React 18.2.0 + TypeScript 5.2.2 with existing shadcn/ui patterns
- Supabase 2.45.4 backend with established RLS policies and real-time subscriptions
- TanStack Query v5 for server state management (5-min cache, 10-min GC)
- Arabic/English bilingual support using existing i18n infrastructure
[Source: docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md#actual-tech-stack]

**Security Requirements**:
- All medical communication must use AES-256 encryption (established in Story 1.2)
- Comprehensive audit trails required for healthcare compliance
- Saudi PDPL data residency and retention compliance
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive discussions
[Source: docs/architecture/security-considerations.md]

**Performance Requirements**:
- Real-time message delivery < 200ms latency
- File upload compression ratio > 50% for media over 1MB
- Voice call connection establishment < 3 seconds
- Push notification delivery < 5 seconds
[Source: docs/architecture/performance-considerations.md]

### Project Structure Context
**Component Architecture**: All communication components follow established shadcn/ui + Radix UI patterns
**Service Layer**: Communication services integrate with existing Supabase client singleton pattern
**Database Integration**: Communication tables use existing RLS policies and encryption infrastructure
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree-and-module-organization.md#project-structure]

### Critical Implementation Gaps to Address
1. **WhatsApp Integration**: Business API integration not implemented - requires webhook setup and n8n workflow enhancement
2. **Voice Call UI**: WebRTC service exists but UI components need completion
3. **Push Notifications**: Service layer partial - browser push and mobile push integration needed
4. **File Sharing Enhancement**: Media upload exists but therapy document categorization and preview missing
5. **Real-time UI**: Backend real-time subscriptions work but frontend components need enhancement

## Testing

### Testing Standards
**Test File Location**: `src/test/` directory with subdirectories mirroring source structure
**Test Framework**: Vitest 3.2.4 with @testing-library/react patterns established in Story 1.1
**Coverage Requirements**: Minimum 80% code coverage for all communication-related code
**Arabic Testing**: Must validate Arabic text rendering and RTL layout in all communication components
**Healthcare Testing**: Must validate PDPL compliance patterns and audit trail generation

**Communication-Specific Testing Requirements**:
- Real-time messaging flow testing with multiple user simulation
- File upload and compression testing with various document types
- Voice call connection and quality testing with network simulation
- WhatsApp API integration testing with webhook validation
- Push notification delivery testing across different platforms
- End-to-end encryption testing with message content validation
