# Story 1.7: QR Attendance System & Real-Time Tracking

**Epic**: Epic 1: Arkan Al-Numo Production Readiness & System Completion

**Story ID**: 1.7

**Priority**: Medium (Operational Efficiency)

**Estimate**: 5-7 days

## User Story

As a **Receptionist and Parent**,  
I want **QR code-based attendance tracking with real-time notifications**,  
so that **session attendance is efficiently managed while integrating with existing session and parent notification systems**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. QR code generation and validation system operational for all sessions
2. Dual-level attendance tracking (center check-in and session-specific) implemented
3. Real-time attendance dashboard provides immediate session status updates
4. Parent notification integration sends automatic check-in/check-out alerts
5. Attendance analytics support existing progress tracking and billing systems
6. Mobile-optimized QR scanning interface accessible on all devices

## Integration Verification

**IV1**: Existing session scheduling and management systems continue functioning with QR attendance integration
**IV2**: Current parent notification preferences preserved during attendance alert implementation
**IV3**: Progress tracking and billing systems automatically utilize QR attendance data

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] All integration verification points passed
- [ ] QR code generation and scanning tested on multiple devices
- [ ] Real-time attendance dashboard functional
- [ ] Parent notification system validated
- [ ] Attendance data integration with billing confirmed

## Dependencies

- Existing session scheduling system (functional)
- QR code generation library (html5-qrcode available)
- Parent notification infrastructure
- Attendance database schema (exists: `database/022_qr_attendance_schema.sql`)
- Mobile-responsive UI framework (Tailwind CSS available)

## Risks & Mitigation

**Risk**: QR codes may be difficult to scan in various lighting conditions
**Mitigation**: Implement QR code optimization and provide manual backup entry option

**Risk**: Real-time updates may impact system performance
**Mitigation**: Optimize database queries and implement efficient caching strategies

**Risk**: Mobile scanning interface may have compatibility issues
**Mitigation**: Test across multiple devices and browsers, provide fallback options

## Technical Notes

- Build upon existing QR components in `src/components/qr/`
- Implement QR generation and validation services (currently UI only)
- Leverage existing attendance tracking infrastructure
- Integrate with existing parent notification patterns
- Create responsive scanning interface optimized for mobile devices
