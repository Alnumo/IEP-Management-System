## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 2.2 Dev Agent Record - Parent Portal System]
- The existing codebase already has sophisticated bilingual (Arabic RTL/English LTR) infrastructure
- Authentication system with role-based access control is well-established
- TanStack Query v5 is used for all server state management with 5-minute stale time
- shadcn/ui components are used consistently for UI elements
- Testing infrastructure uses Vitest with comprehensive test patterns

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md - Financial Management Schema]

**installment_plans Table**:
- subscription_id: uuid (FK to student_subscriptions.id)
- total_amount: numeric
- due_date: date
- amount_paid: numeric  
- status: enum ('pending', 'paid', 'overdue')
- Belongs to one student_subscription

**New Financial Tables Required**:
- financial_transactions: Track all payment transactions with audit trail
- invoice_templates: Customizable invoice formats for different programs
- payment_reminders: Automated reminder scheduling and tracking

**Integration Points**:
- Direct foreign key relationships to existing students and therapy_programs tables
- Leverages existing student_subscriptions table for enrollment data
- Must respect existing RLS policies and extend with financial data protection

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/component-architecture.md - Financial Backend Service]

**Financial Service (Supabase Edge Function)**:
- createInstallmentPlan(subscriptionId, totalAmount, installments)
- getInstallmentPlan(subscriptionId)
- processPayment(transactionData, paymentMethod)
- generateInvoice(studentId, programId, billingPeriod)
- getFinancialReports(dateRange, filters)

**Payment Gateway Integration**:
- Must implement secure tokenization for payment methods
- Webhook handlers for real-time payment status updates
- PCI compliance requirements for payment processing
- Integration with Saudi payment methods and currency formatting

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/component-architecture.md - Financial UI Components]

**Frontend Components Required**:
