## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards
**Testing Framework**: Vitest (existing framework in the project)
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#integration-with-existing-tests]

**Testing Patterns**: Continue using "Arrange, Act, Assert" pattern for all unit tests
[Source: architecture/coding-standards-and-conventions.md#existing-standards-compliance]

**Coverage Requirements**: All new code must meet minimum 80% unit test coverage
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#new-testing-requirements]

**Component Testing**: Every React component requires corresponding .test.tsx file covering rendering, user interactions, and all states (loading, error, success)
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#unit-tests-for-new-components]

### Technical Constraints
**React Testing Library**: Use React Testing Library alongside Vitest for component testing
[Source: architecture/coding-standards-and-conventions.md#testing-patterns]

**Error Handling**: All test components must work within existing multi-level ErrorBoundary structure
[Source: architecture/coding-standards-and-conventions.md#error-handling]

**Bilingual Support**: Test components must validate both Arabic RTL and English LTR functionality where applicable

### File Locations
Based on existing project structure:
- Test files: Co-located with source files using `.test.tsx` or `.test.ts` extensions
- Test utilities: `src/test-utils/` (if not exists, create following existing patterns)
- Test coverage reports: Standard Vitest coverage output directory

### Integration Requirements
**Technology Stack**: Continue using existing stack - React 18.2, TypeScript 5.3, Vitest
[Source: architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md#existing-technology-stack]

**ESLint/Prettier**: All test code must pass existing linting rules without new warnings
[Source: architecture/coding-standards-and-conventions.md#code-style]

## Testing
This story establishes the testing infrastructure, so it includes:
- Tests for test utility functions
- Validation of coverage reporting functionality
- Integration test for CI/CD pipeline test execution
