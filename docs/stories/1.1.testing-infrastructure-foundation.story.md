## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in the epic, no previous story context available.

### Technical Context
**Current Testing State**: 0% test coverage despite Vitest 3.2.4 being configured. This is identified as CRITICAL TECHNICAL DEBT blocking production deployment.  
[Source: architecture/technical-debt-and-known-issues.md#critical-technical-debt]  
[Source: architecture/testing-reality.md#current-test-coverage]

**Existing Testing Infrastructure**:
- Vitest 3.2.4 configured but unused
- @testing-library/react 16.3.0 available
- @testing-library/jest-dom 6.8.0 available  
- @testing-library/user-event 14.6.1 available
- @vitest/coverage-v8 3.2.4 available for coverage reporting
- Test scripts already configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:ui`
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#actual-tech-stack]

### Project Structure Context
**Test File Location**: `src/test/` directory exists with minimal coverage  
**Source Structure**: 213+ UI components across multiple domains (admin, analytics, auth, billing, forms, etc.)  
**Key Components to Test**:
- Forms in `src/components/forms/` (inconsistent patterns noted)
- UI components in `src/components/ui/` (shadcn/ui based)
- Parent portal in `src/components/parent/`
- Core business components in `src/components/students/`, `src/components/therapy/`
[Source: architecture/source-tree-and-module-organization.md#project-structure]

### Technical Constraints
**Arabic/RTL Requirements**:
- Must support Arabic text rendering with proper RTL layout
- Font loading order is critical: "Must use specific font loading order or text renders incorrectly"
- Tailwind CSS 3.4.12 with RTL support via tailwind-merge
- Fonts: Tajawal, Cairo for Arabic content
[Source: architecture/technical-debt-and-known-issues.md#workarounds-and-gotchas]

**Technology Stack Requirements**:
- React 18.2.0 with hooks and concurrent features
- TypeScript 5.2.2 in strict mode
- shadcn/ui + Radix UI components
- Supabase 2.45.4 backend integration required for integration tests
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#actual-tech-stack]

**Environment Setup**:
- Must have all VITE_ prefixed environment variables or app crashes
- Supabase client singleton pattern required for database connections
[Source: architecture/technical-debt-and-known-issues.md#workarounds-and-gotchas]

### Integration Requirements
**Database Integration**: Integration tests must use Supabase test environment without breaking existing data
**Real-time Features**: No real-time subscriptions implemented yet, but may need mocking framework
**Authentication**: Tests must work with Supabase Auth JWT pattern
[Source: architecture/source-tree-and-module-organization.md#key-modules]

### File Locations for Implementation
- Test configuration: `vitest.config.ts` (exists)
- Test files location: `src/test/` directory
- Component tests: Mirror `src/components/` structure in `src/test/components/`
- Integration tests: `src/test/integration/`
- Test utilities: `src/test/utils/`
- Coverage configuration: Update `vitest.config.ts`

### Performance Requirements
Must maintain sub-2-second page loads and sub-500ms API responses during test execution
[Source: epic requirements]

## Testing

### Testing Standards
**Test File Location**: `src/test/` directory with subdirectories mirroring source structure
**Test Framework**: Vitest 3.2.4 with @testing-library/react patterns
**Coverage Requirements**: Minimum 80% code coverage across all domains
**Arabic Testing**: Must validate Arabic text rendering and RTL layout in all component tests
**Mobile Testing**: Must validate responsive behavior for parent portal optimization
**Integration Testing**: Use Supabase test environment with proper data isolation

**Testing Patterns to Establish**:
- Component testing with Arabic/English language switching
- Mobile responsive viewport testing
