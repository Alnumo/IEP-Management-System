# Story 1.1: Testing Infrastructure Foundation

**Epic**: Epic 1: Arkan Al-Numo Production Readiness & System Completion

**Story ID**: 1.1

**Priority**: Critical (Blocker)

**Estimate**: 5-8 days

## User Story

As a **Development Team**,  
I want **comprehensive testing infrastructure with 80% code coverage**,  
so that **the existing system maintains reliability during remaining development and production deployment**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Vitest testing framework configured with Arabic RTL and mobile responsive testing capabilities
2. Unit tests implemented for all existing core components (StudentForm, TherapistForm, SessionForm, ParentPortal)
3. Integration tests created for critical workflows (enrollment, assessment, progress tracking)
4. Test coverage reporting achieves 80% minimum across all domains
5. Arabic language and RTL layout testing framework operational
6. Mobile responsive testing suite validates existing parent portal optimization

## Integration Verification

**IV1**: Existing component functionality verified through comprehensive test suites without breaking changes
**IV2**: Current API endpoints and database operations validated through integration tests
**IV3**: Performance benchmarks established confirming sub-2-second load times maintained

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] All integration verification points passed
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Performance benchmarks maintained

## Dependencies

- Existing Vitest configuration (available)
- Access to all existing components and services
- Arabic font testing infrastructure setup

## Risks & Mitigation

**Risk**: Implementing tests on untested legacy code may reveal hidden bugs
**Mitigation**: Treat discovered bugs as separate stories, focus on preventing regressions

**Risk**: Arabic RTL testing complexity
**Mitigation**: Use proven RTL testing libraries and establish clear test patterns

## Technical Notes

- Build upon existing Vitest configuration in project
- Focus on critical path components first (authentication, data operations)
- Establish Arabic text rendering test patterns for reuse
- Create test data sets that include Arabic content
