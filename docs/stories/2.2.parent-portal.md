## Dev Notes

This story implements FR2.1 (Parent Portal) from the PRD requirements, providing parents with comprehensive access to their child's therapy progress and enabling effective communication with the therapy team.

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 2.1 Dev Agent Record]

**Technical Patterns to Follow:** Story 2.1 established comprehensive patterns that should be replicated:
- React 18.2 + TypeScript 5.3 with strict mode compliance
- Bilingual support (Arabic RTL/English LTR) throughout all components  
- shadcn/ui components for consistent UI design
- React Hook Form + Zod validation for form handling
- TanStack Query v5 for data management with 5-minute stale time
- Comprehensive test coverage using Vitest and React Testing Library
- Database migrations with RLS policies by default
- Service layer pattern with TypeScript interfaces

**Implementation Quality Standards:** Story 2.1 demonstrated exceptional implementation quality with:
- Advanced analytics capabilities with statistical analysis
- Real-time data processing with optimized caching
- Comprehensive error handling and validation systems
- Performance optimization with memoization and lazy loading
- Complete accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Integration with existing workflow systems

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md]

**Technology Stack:** React 18.2 + TypeScript 5.3 + Supabase + TanStack Query v5
- Continue using functional components with hooks
- Enforce TypeScript strict mode for code quality
- All new backend logic deployed as Supabase Edge Functions
- All new tables must include RLS policies by default
- Continue using 5-minute stale time for TanStack Query cached data

### Component Organization
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree-integration.md]

**File Locations:**
- Parent portal components: `src/components/parent/` (existing directory)
- Parent portal types: `src/types/parent.ts` (new file)
- Parent portal hooks: `src/hooks/useParentPortal.ts` (new file)
- Parent portal pages: `src/pages/ParentPortalPage.tsx` (new file)
- Parent portal services: `src/services/parent-portal-service.ts` (new file)

**Naming Conventions:** All new components follow PascalCase.tsx convention with modular organization

### Database Integration
[Source: docs/architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md]

**Migration Strategy:** All changes implemented via numbered SQL migration files following existing pattern
- Next migration number: 032_parent_portal_schema.sql
- All new tables require appropriate indexes on foreign keys and frequently queried columns
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies mandatory for all tables containing sensitive data

### Integration Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/component-architecture.md]

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrate with student management system (existing students table)
- Connect to therapy session data for progress visualization
- Link with IEP management for goal tracking
- Maintain compatibility with existing authentication and RBAC
- Use existing ErrorBoundary structure for error handling

### Coding Standards
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards-and-conventions.md]

**Critical Integration Rules:**
- All TypeScript types shared between frontend/backend must be in `src/types/` directory
- All frontend API interactions managed through TanStack Query v5 (no direct fetch calls)
- All environment variables prefixed with VITE_ and accessed through validated environment object
- Components designed to work within existing multi-level ErrorBoundary structure
- Bilingual JSDoc comments (Arabic and English) required for all functions and components

**Testing Standards:** All new tests written using Vitest and React Testing Library with "Arrange, Act, Assert" pattern

### Real-time Features
[Source: Story 2.1 implementation patterns]
