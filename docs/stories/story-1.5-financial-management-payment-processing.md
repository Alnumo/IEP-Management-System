## Dependencies

- Billing system database schema (exists: `database/023_billing_system_schema.sql`)
- Financial reporting infrastructure

## Risks & Mitigation

**Risk**: Payment gateway integration complexity and regional compliance
**Mitigation**: Thoroughly test with sandbox environments, consult with regional payment experts

**Risk**: Insurance API integration may have strict requirements
**Mitigation**: Early engagement with insurance providers, implement fallback manual processes

**Risk**: Automated billing may generate incorrect invoices
**Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive validation and approval workflows before automation

## Technical Notes

- Build upon existing `src/services/payment-gateway-service.ts` (needs implementation)
