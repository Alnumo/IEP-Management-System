## Dev Notes

This story implements the critical security foundation identified in Epic 1 and addresses security gaps from the gap analysis. All technical requirements have been extracted from architecture documents and existing database security implementations.

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: docs/stories/1.1.testing-infrastructure-implementation.story.md]

Story 1.1 completed successfully with comprehensive testing infrastructure. Key insights for security implementation:
- Enhanced Supabase client mocking strategies can inform security testing approaches  
- Comprehensive testing patterns established for bilingual functionality testing
- Testing utilities in `src/test/utils/bilingual-test-utils.tsx` can be extended for security testing
- Technical debt noted: Some service test files have Supabase mocking issues requiring attention

### Database Security Foundation
[Source: database/013_medical_policies.sql]

**Existing Security Infrastructure:** Comprehensive RLS policies already implemented with:
- Medical consultant access controls via `is_medical_consultant()` function
- Student supervision access via `has_medical_supervision_access()` function  
- Enhanced audit logging via `log_medical_data_changes()` trigger function
- Emergency access procedures via `emergency_medical_access()` function
- Medical data backup procedures via `create_medical_backup()` function

**Security Tables Already Available:**
- `medical_records` - with RLS policies for admin, medical consultant, therapist, receptionist access
- `medical_consultants` - with profile and colleague access policies
- `clinical_documentation` - with comprehensive access controls and parent limited access
- `medical_supervision_assignments` - with consultant and therapist access policies
- `audit_logs` - for comprehensive change tracking with IP and user agent logging

### Data Models and Encryption Requirements
[Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md]

**Encryption Strategy:** All new tables include foreign key relationships to existing students table with RLS policies applied by default. Medical data encryption must:
- Maintain compatibility with existing `can_access_encrypted_data()` function
- Use PostgreSQL 15 native encryption capabilities  
- Support field-level encryption for sensitive medical information
- Include encryption status tracking in medical records

### Technical Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md]

**Security Framework:** Continue using existing technology stack:
- **Backend:** Supabase Edge Functions for secure API endpoints with existing RLS model
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 15 with native encryption and existing audit procedures
- **Authentication:** Enhance Supabase Auth with 2FA integration
- **Language:** TypeScript 5.3 with strict mode for all security-related code

### API Design and Security Integration  
[Source: architecture/api-design-and-integration.md]

**Security Endpoints:** New backend functionality will be exposed via dedicated API endpoints maintaining existing API structure:
- Rate limiting integration with existing Supabase client configuration
- Session security enhancements within current TanStack Query v5 framework
- Security headers and CORS policies for existing API endpoints

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Security Testing Standards:** All security implementations require comprehensive testing:
- **Unit Tests:** Security function testing with edge cases and error conditions
- **Integration Tests:** End-to-end security workflow testing including authentication and authorization
- **Compliance Testing:** HIPAA and PDPL compliance verification testing
- **Performance Testing:** Encryption/decryption performance impact measurement
- **Penetration Testing:** Security vulnerability assessment

### Project Structure Integration
[Source: architecture/source-tree-integration.md]

**Security File Organization:** Security components should be organized following existing structure:
- `src/components/auth/` - 2FA setup and authentication security components
- `src/services/` - Security service functions (encryption, audit, compliance)
- `src/hooks/` - Security-related custom hooks for 2FA and audit access
- `src/types/` - Security-related TypeScript types and interfaces

**File Locations for New Security Code:**
- `src/services/encryption-service.ts` - HIPAA-compliant encryption functions
- `src/services/audit-service.ts` - Enhanced audit trail service  
- `src/services/security-service.ts` - 2FA and session security functions
- `src/components/auth/TwoFactorSetup.tsx` - 2FA setup component
- `src/components/auth/EmergencyAccess.tsx` - Emergency access component
- `src/hooks/useTwoFactor.ts` - 2FA management hook
- `src/types/security.ts` - Security-related type definitions

### Compliance Requirements
[Source: docs/gap-analysis.md - Section 2.3]

**Critical Compliance Gaps Addressed:**
- **HIPAA Compliance:** Medical data encryption implementation with audit trails
- **FERPA Compliance:** Educational record access controls testing and validation  
- **PDPL Compliance:** Saudi Personal Data Protection Law alignment for all user data
- **Data Retention:** Automated data lifecycle management implementation
- **Backup Strategy:** Secure data backup and recovery procedures

### Security Testing Strategy

### Integration Test Requirements  
- End-to-end security workflow testing for all user roles
- Authentication and authorization integration testing
- Database security policy testing with RLS validation
- Audit trail integration testing with compliance reporting

### Security Test Environment Setup
