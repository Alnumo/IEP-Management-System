# Archon MCP Project Setup: Arkan Al-Numo IEP Management System

## Status
- **Archon MCP Server**: ✅ Connected (http://localhost:8051/mcp)
- **Function Access**: ❌ Not exposed in Claude Code interface
- **Ready for Execution**: ✅ Complete setup plan documented

## Immediate Action Required
The Archon MCP server is connected but the functions are not accessible through Claude Code. This requires troubleshooting the MCP function mapping.

# If needed, additional feature categories can be created
```

## Expected Project Structure

Once executed, the Archon project will have:

### **Project Container**
- **Title**: Arkan Al-Numo IEP Management System
- **Description**: Comprehensive bilingual IEP management system
- **Knowledge Base**: 25+ research queries and code examples
- **Tasks**: 10 prioritized development tasks (1-4 hours each)

### **Research Knowledge Base**
- Architecture patterns for React + TypeScript + Supabase
- Multi-tenant security with Supabase RLS
- Arabic RTL internationalization best practices  
- Real-time collaboration implementation
- Educational analytics and progress tracking
- Healthcare scheduling and session management

### **Development Tasks** (Prioritized by task_order)
1. **Foundation Setup** (Priority: 10)
2. **Database & Security** (Priority: 9) 
3. **Bilingual Infrastructure** (Priority: 8)
4. **Student Management** (Priority: 7)
5. **Staff Management** (Priority: 6)
6. **IEP Management** (Priority: 5)
7. **Session Scheduling** (Priority: 4)
8. **Analytics Dashboard** (Priority: 3)
9. **Real-time Features** (Priority: 2)
10. **Mobile Optimization** (Priority: 1)

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Archon Function Access**: Ensure Archon MCP functions are properly exposed in Claude Code
2. **Execute Setup Commands**: Run the complete command sequence above
3. **Begin Task-Driven Development**: Start with highest priority tasks and follow Archon workflow
4. **Research Integration**: Use knowledge base findings to guide implementation decisions

## Technical Foundation Ready

The enhanced project brief (`E:\app\app1\docs\brief-enhanced.md`) contains comprehensive technical implementation details that align with the Archon research queries and will guide development once the project is created.
