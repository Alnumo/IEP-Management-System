# Enhancement Scope and Integration Strategy

Based on my analysis, the integration approach for the new enhancements will prioritize stability, consistency, and minimal disruption to the existing production environment. The new modules will be built as extensions of the current architecture, leveraging existing patterns and services wherever possible.

## Enhancement Overview

Enhancement Type: This is a major feature enhancement, introducing new core modules (CRM, Scheduling, Financials) and completing existing ones (IEP, Parent Portal) to transition the application into a full-fledged ERP system.

Scope: The scope includes database schema extensions, new frontend components and pages, new Supabase Edge Functions for business logic, and new n8n workflows for automation.

Integration Impact: Significant Impact. While we will follow existing patterns, the new modules will introduce new data models and workflows that will interact extensively with the current students, therapists, and therapy_plans tables.

## Integration Approach

Code Integration Strategy: New features will be developed within the existing monorepo structure. Frontend components will be added to src/components/ under new domain folders (e.g., src/components/crm/, src/components/scheduling/). Backend logic will be implemented as new Supabase Edge Functions.

Database Integration: The enhancement will require extending the current PostgreSQL schema. New tables for leads, installments, attendance_logs, and subscriptions will be created with foreign key relationships to the existing students table. All new tables will have Row Level Security (RLS) policies applied by default, consistent with the current security model.

API Integration: New backend functionality will be exposed via new, dedicated API endpoints. We will maintain the existing API structure and will not introduce breaking changes to current endpoints.

UI Integration: New pages and features will be integrated into the existing React Router DOM v6 structure and will appear as new items in the role-based sidebar navigation.

## Compatibility Requirements

Existing API Compatibility: All existing API endpoints will remain fully backward compatible. No breaking changes will be introduced.

Database Schema Compatibility: All database changes will be additive. No existing columns or tables will be removed or altered in a way that breaks the current application.

UI/UX Consistency: All new components and views will adhere strictly to the established design system in ui-ux-specification.md, using the existing shadcn/ui component library, color palette, and typography.

Performance Impact: New features must not degrade the performance of the existing application. New database queries will be optimized, and frontend additions will adhere to the performance targets of < 2-second load times.

VALIDATION CHECKPOINT: The integration approach I'm proposing takes into account your serverless Supabase backend and modular React frontend. These integration points and boundaries are designed to respect your current architecture patterns.
