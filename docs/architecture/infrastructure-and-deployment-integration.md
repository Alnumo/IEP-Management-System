# Infrastructure and Deployment Integration

The deployment strategy for the enhancements will integrate directly into your existing Netlify and Supabase CI/CD pipelines. The goal is to ensure that new features are deployed safely, with zero downtime, and that rollback procedures are in place.

## Existing Infrastructure

Current Deployment: The frontend is continuously deployed to Netlify, with automatic builds triggered from the main branch. The backend consists of Supabase services, where database migrations and Edge Functions are managed via the Supabase CLI.

Infrastructure Tools: Netlify for frontend hosting/CDN; Supabase for all backend services.

Environments: The current setup includes a production environment and local development environments. We will introduce a formal staging environment.

## Enhancement Deployment Strategy

Deployment Approach: We will use a phased rollout. Backend database migrations will be deployed first, followed by the Supabase Edge Functions. Once the backend APIs are live and stable, the frontend features will be deployed.

Infrastructure Changes:

Staging Environment: A new Supabase project will be configured to serve as a dedicated staging environment for end-to-end testing before production releases.

Environment Variables: New environment variables for the Amelia webhook and WhatsApp API integration will be added securely to Supabase and Netlify.

Pipeline Integration: The existing Netlify build process will be updated to include a new test stage that must pass before a deployment to production can proceed.

## Rollback Strategy

Rollback Method: For the frontend, Netlify's atomic deployments allow for instant rollbacks to a previous version with a single click. For the backend, a new, versioned SQL script will be created for each database migration that contains the necessary commands to reverse the schema changes.

Risk Mitigation: All new, significant features will be deployed with feature flags. This will allow us to enable or disable the new CRM, Scheduling, and Financial modules in production without requiring a full redeployment, minimizing risk.
