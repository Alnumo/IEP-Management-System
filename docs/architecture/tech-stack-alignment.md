# Tech Stack Alignment

The guiding principle for this enhancement is to maintain 100% consistency with the existing technology stack. The new features and modules are designed to be built using the same frameworks, libraries, and services that are currently in production. This approach minimizes risk, ensures maintainability, and leverages the existing team expertise.

My analysis confirms that no new technologies are required to implement the features outlined in the PRD, including the CRM, scheduling, and financial modules. The existing stack is robust and well-suited for these additions.

## Existing Technology Stack for Enhancement

The following table documents the current technology stack that will be used for all new development. All versions and patterns will be strictly adhered to.

Category	Current Technology	Version	Usage in Enhancement	Notes
Frontend Framework	React	18.2	All new UI components and pages (CRM, Scheduling, etc.)	Continue using functional components with hooks.
Language	TypeScript	5.3	All new frontend and backend code.	Enforce strict mode to maintain code quality.
Backend Platform	Supabase	N/A	All backend services, database, and authentication.	New backend logic will be deployed as Supabase Edge Functions.
Database	PostgreSQL	15	All new tables (leads, subscriptions, installments, etc.).	All new tables will include RLS policies by default.
Styling	Tailwind CSS	3.4	All new UI components.	Continue to use existing design tokens and utility classes.
UI Components	shadcn/ui	N/A	All new UI elements (forms, tables, dialogs, etc.).	Guarantees visual and interactive consistency.
State Management	TanStack Query v5	5	Management of all server state for new features.	Continue using a 5-minute stale time for cached data.
Automation	n8n	N/A	New workflows for CRM and scheduling reminders.	New webhooks will be configured for these workflows.

This disciplined approach ensures that the enhancements feel like a native part of the existing application, rather than a disconnected addition.
