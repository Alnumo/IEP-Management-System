# Next Steps

This Brownfield Enhancement Architecture document, having been collaboratively developed and approved, now serves as the definitive technical blueprint for this project phase. All subsequent development, story creation, and testing must align with the decisions and patterns defined herein.

The successful completion of this architecture marks the end of the initial planning and design phase. The project will now transition into the implementation and development workflow.

## Story Manager Handoff

The next action is for the Story Manager (SM) to begin breaking down the epics from the PRD into detailed, actionable user stories for the development team.

Handoff Prompt for Story Manager:
"The architecture for the Arkan Alnumo enhancement is complete and approved. Please begin creating the user stories based on the prd.md. Key considerations for this brownfield project include:

Reference this architecture document for all technical implementation details.

Pay close attention to the Integration Strategy (Section 2) and Compatibility Requirements (Section 2.3) to ensure all stories maintain existing system integrity.

Each story's acceptance criteria must include verification steps to prevent regressions in existing functionality.

The initial stories should focus on setting up the new database schemas and backend services as outlined in the Data Models (Section 4) and API Design (Section 6)."

## Developer Handoff

Once stories are created and approved, they will be handed off to the Development Agent.

Guidance for the Development Agent:
"You are to begin implementation of the approved user stories for the Arkan Alnumo enhancement. Your work must strictly adhere to the following:

The technical patterns, component designs, and API specifications defined in this architecture document.

The Coding Standards and Testing Strategy (Sections 10 & 11) are mandatory.

All new code must integrate with the existing project structure as defined in the Source Tree Integration section (Section 8).

Your primary objective is to deliver the required enhancements while ensuring the stability and integrity of the existing production system."
