# Arkan Alnumo Brownfield Enhancement Architecture

This document outlines the architectural approach for enhancing the Arkan Alnumo system. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development of new features while ensuring seamless and safe integration with the existing, production-ready system.

This document supplements the existing architecture by defining how new components and modules—such as the CRM, advanced scheduling, and a complete IEP system—will integrate with the current infrastructure.
