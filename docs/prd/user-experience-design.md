# User Experience Design

## Design Integration Principles

**Existing UI Integration**: New communication features integrate seamlessly with current shadcn/ui component library, established Arabic RTL patterns, and existing bilingual Arabic/English interface standards

**Modified Screens**:

- Enhanced Student Profile with communication history
- New Voice Communication Modal with Arabic RTL support
- Enhanced Session Documentation with media upload workflow
- New Assignment Management Dashboard for administrators
- Enhanced Scheduling Interface with conflict resolution automation

**UI Consistency Requirements**:
- All new interfaces use established Tajawal and Cairo Arabic fonts
- Communication components follow existing form validation and error handling patterns
- New features respect existing role-based UI component rendering
- Media interfaces maintain existing mobile-responsive design standards
- Voice communication UI follows established modal and dialog patterns
