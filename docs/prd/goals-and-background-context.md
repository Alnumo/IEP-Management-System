# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
The primary goal is to evolve the Arkan Growth Center Therapy Plans Manager into a complete, end-to-end Individualized Education Program (IEP) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. This involves three key strategic objectives:

Audit and Complete Existing Functionality: Address all issues and missing features identified in the gap analysis to bring the current application to 100% completion.

Implement New Core Features: Introduce new, critical modules for student management, scheduling, and communication as detailed in the brainstorming session results.

Introduce Advanced Capabilities: Integrate AI-powered features and n8n automation workflows to enhance efficiency, provide data-driven insights, and improve user experience.

## Background Context
The Arkan Therapy Management System is approximately 75-80% complete, with a robust technical foundation based on React, TypeScript, and Supabase. A comprehensive gap analysis has revealed specific areas needing completion, particularly in testing, security, and core modules like IEP Management and the Parent Portal.

Recent brainstorming sessions have identified a clear need for a more sophisticated student lifecycle and scheduling system to fully realize the vision of an all-encompassing ERP platform. This PRD will guide the development process to bridge these gaps and introduce new, value-added features.
