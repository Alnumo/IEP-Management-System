  notes: |
    Story 1.1 demonstrates excellent testing infrastructure implementation with 
    comprehensive bilingual support and extensive test coverage. The technical 
    issues identified are addressable and do not prevent deployment with monitoring.
    
    The bilingual testing utilities are particularly impressive and set a strong 
    foundation for future development. The integration test coverage adequately 
    validates critical business workflows.
    
    Recommend deployment with close monitoring of test performance and resolution 
    of identified timeout issues.
