# Gate decision rationale
gate_rationale: |
  PASS decision based on:
  
  1. **Complete AC Coverage**: All 6 acceptance criteria fully implemented with evidence
  2. **Risk Mitigation**: Critical risks TECH-001 and DATA-001 comprehensively addressed
  3. **Quality Excellence**: Implementation demonstrates exceptional architecture and patterns
  4. **Healthcare Compliance**: HIPAA/PDPL compliant testing with proper data isolation
  5. **Production Readiness**: Infrastructure ready for deployment with robust coverage
  
  This story successfully transforms the system from 0% to production-ready test coverage,
  establishing a solid foundation for all future development and ensuring system reliability
  during remaining development phases.
